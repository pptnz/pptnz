Hi, I'm Minji! 😄 

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University advised by Dr. Aaron Newman. 

🧬 My research focuses on decoding molecular biology data to discover the biological mechanisms underlying stem cells and to identify immature cell populations in cancer. Currently, I am developing machine learning models for inferring cell development potential from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. 

☕️ Outside of research, I love listening to music, playing the piano, taking photos, and drinking tea.
